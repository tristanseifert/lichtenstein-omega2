# Lichtenstein Omega2+
This is a version of the Lichtenstein hardware, using an [Onion Omega2+](https://onion.io/omega2/) and a MAX V CPLD to drive up to eight LED strips at once.

Connectivity is provided by the Omega2's Ethernet peripheral. The board itself runs a custom version of LEDE, with the lichtenstein client app running and providing lichtenstein services on the local subnet.
